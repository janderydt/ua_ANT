The fields in NewRuns and RunTable are defined as follows:
Mesh: define basemesh which needs to be adapted to account for the correct ice front location
InverseA: Inverse experiment ID from which A is taken
InverseAFill: Inverse experiment ID from which A is taken to fill holes outside boundary of InverseA
InverseC: Inverse experiment ID from which C is taken
InverseCFill: Inverse experiment ID from which C is taken to fill holes outside boundary of InverseC
Calv: year of calving front location（2000， 2009， 2014， 2018）
ISthick: year of ice shelf thickness
GIthick: year of grounded ice sheet thickness. If ISthick ~= GIthick then ISthick will be applied only to nodes that are floating for the GIthick geometry
